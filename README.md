# Ace Squadron

Hello and welcome to Ace Squadron. Here you will build or use an already created Squad. These will then do battle until there is only one alive. The units are broken right now, and are there primarily for fun. If you want a more balanced game, do not use the Deathstar. If you want a fun surprise just type the Koonami code in on the squad creation page.

During this project, I worked on both the front and backend. Making the website look pretty and have a great UI, while also insuring the api and it's routing worked flawlessly. 
<br><br>
The biggest thing I learned while working on this project was definetly to start with data handling and routing. It is a lot more fun and easy to do the front end, but the front end doesn't matter if there is no data to work with. So from now on, on smaller personally projects I shall start on the backend.
